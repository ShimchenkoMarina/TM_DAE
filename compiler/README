How to compile?

Type make inside TM_DAE/compiler.
Make sure your firewall allows to download from GitHub. 
The project will download:
	1. LLVM 3.8
	2. CALNG
	3. TOOLS 
	4. TM_DAE
	5. SVF-1-3
If all the SW requirements are met, the project should build itself. 
Have fun!

Please note, that this is a preliminary version only. 
It contains many bugs and horrible code style.
